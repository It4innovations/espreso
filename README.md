#HIGHLY PARALLEL SOLVERS FOR ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS.

ESPRESO is an ExaScale PaRallel FETI SOlver developed at Czech national supercomputing centre IT4Innovations. Main focus of the development team is to create a highly efficient parallel solver which contains several FETI based algorithms including Hybrid Total FETI method suitable for parallel machines with tens or hundreds of thousands of cores. The solver is based on highly efficient communication layer on top of pure MPI.

The documentation and detailed description of the library can be found [here](http://espreso.it4i.cz/).
